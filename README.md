# Monitoring Deforestation in Madagascar Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Supervised Machine Learning

## Project Background

Madagascar is renowned as one of the world’s most significant biodiversity hotspots. However, it is facing an alarming rate of deforestation that threatens its unique ecosystems and global climate stability. Over 90% of Madagascar’s wildlife, including iconic endemic species such as lemurs, fossas, and tenrecs, relies on forest habitats that are rapidly disappearing due to human activity. Over the last 20 years (2001 - 2021), Madagascar lost approximately 4.85 million hectares of tree cover, equivalent to a 25% decrease in forested area, resulting in an estimated 2.52 gigatonnes of CO₂-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions (Suzzi-Simmons, 2023).

This deforestation is primarily driven by potential economic profit, including slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, illegal logging, and forest arson. These activities are often associated with rural poverty, creating a feedback loop that accelerates deforestation and biodiversity loss. With an ongoing annual loss of roughly 200,000 hectares, Madagascar has already lost around 80% of its original forest cover, and projections suggest that, without intervention, the remaining forests could vanish entirely within the next 25 years (Vieilledent et al., 2020).

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing offer powerful tools for monitoring and analysing deforestation with greater precision and efficiency. By using satellite imagery, such as data from the  Sentinel missions and applying machine learning algorithms for land cover classification, researchers can detect subtle changes in forest cover, quantify rates of loss, and identify spatial patterns of degradation over time. These technologies not only enhance the accuracy of deforestation assessments but also enable near-real-time monitoring, which is crucial for early intervention and policy response. In the context of Madagascar, where access to remote forest regions can be limited, AI-driven analysis provides a scalable and cost-effective approach to track environmental change, inform conservation planning, and support enforcement against illegal activities contributing to forest loss.


### Objectives:
  * Use Sentinel-2 imagery to classify land cover in selected regions of Madagascar
  * Detect forest loss between two years (e.g., 2018 vs. 2023)

### Research questions:

  * Can Sentinel-2 imagery effectively classify forested vs. deforested areas in Madagascar?
  * What regions show the greatest forest loss over the selected timeframe?
